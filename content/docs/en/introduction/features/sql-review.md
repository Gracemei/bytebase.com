title: SQL Review
---

SQL Review is the classic and widely used process for developers and DBAs to coordinate database schema changes.

Developers first submit their SQL statement for DBA to review. After review is approved, the SQL statement will then be applied to the corresponding database. For a single change, this step would normally be repeated for each environment (e.g. integration, staging, prod).
